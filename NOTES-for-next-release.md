## Release Notes (for next release)

This is a summary of changes and features in `master`, but not yet in the Chrome Store release.

- Visual mode (in beta): use `v` and then vim-like movements to select text on the page. Use `y` to yank or `p`/`P` to search. Please provide feedback on Github.

- Improved custom search engines: bug fixes and search engines can now have a description.

- An option to stop pages from focusing an input (thus stealing focus from Vimium) when loaded.

- Find mode now has history. Use the up arrow to repeat previous searches.

- Ctrl and Shift when using link hints modifies which tab links are opened in (reinstated feature).

- Focus input (`gi`) remembers previously-visited inputs.

- Better support for frames: key exclusion rules are much improved and work within frames; the vomnibar is always activated in the main frame; and a new command (`gF`) focuses the main frame.

- Many bug fixes and improvements.
